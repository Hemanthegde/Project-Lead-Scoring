# Lead Scoring Case Study

  As a part of the Lead Scoring case study, we have been presented with the 
details how the company X Education pursues customer leads from various 
sources and tries to convert them to potential customers.
The current conversion rate is quite low at 30%. So, we have been tasked to 
analyze the data and come up with a model which can make predictions to 
the order to 80% Lead conversion.
